"""Publish the product's semantic model to Fabric, and hold it to gold.

The DEFINITION is core's (`contoso_product.semantic`): tables, columns,
measures, and the rule that every family number has one. This module is the
binding — the half core may not hold, because core names no engine. It builds
the Direct Lake M expression from the run's own workspace and warehouse ids,
publishes the item over the Fabric REST surface, and queries it back through
the Power BI `executeQueries` contract.

WHY THE CONTRACT READS GOLD TWICE. `semantic_verdict` sums the same three
columns over TDS and evaluates the same three measures over DAX, then requires
them equal. That is deliberately not "assert the family's numbers": those are
already asserted by `compare_products`, and a semantic layer that merely
repeats a constant would pass while serving a model bound to the wrong table.
What this proves is that the BI path and the SQL path read the same rows of
the same run — so a model pointed at a stale warehouse, an empty schema, or
yesterday's entity fails even when the constant would have matched.
