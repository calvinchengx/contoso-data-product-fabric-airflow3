"""The workspace and lakehouse this product needs, created if absent.

Addressed BY NAME, never by id. The id differs per target and per run; the name
is the cross-target address, and it is what makes the same DAG resolve to the
right place on the emulator and on real Fabric.

Idempotent because a pipeline run is not a first run. After day one the normal
case is that everything already exists, and a provisioner that treats that as an
error is a provisioner that can only be run once.
