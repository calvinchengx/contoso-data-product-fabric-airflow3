"""Where Fabric is, and who we are to it — resolved from an Airflow Connection.

THE PRODUCT NEVER LEARNS WHICH TARGET ANSWERED. A DAG says `conn_id="fabric"`;
the platform provisions that connection against the emulator locally and against
real Fabric in production, and nothing here branches on which.

This is the same seam `fabric-platform-notebook-pipelines/platform/target.py` occupies, and
its comment states the principle better than a restatement would:

    THE GRANT TYPE IS NOT DECIDED HERE, and that is the point. […] The target
    resolves a credential instead, so who is authenticating is the deployment's
    business and not this module's.

The audiences are the REAL Fabric ones on both targets — the emulator validates
the same strings. Asking for `https://storage.azure.com` is not an emulator
concession; it is what the token is for.

NO azure-identity. Against the emulator it is not installed, and reaching for it
is how Phase 0 ended up authenticating against real Microsoft endpoints with a
developer's own `az login` state. A client-credentials POST is nine lines of
stdlib and cannot silently retarget production.

        seam already avoids by arriving as data.

        So the deployment states its own storage options and this merges them.
        Against real Fabric the connection supplies none and the default
        Azure endpoint applies; locally the platform supplies the emulator's
        endpoint and its self-signed-certificate allowance. Neither is named
        here.
