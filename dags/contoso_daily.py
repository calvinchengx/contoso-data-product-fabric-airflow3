"""The Contoso daily pipeline: four vendors → landing → bronze.

This replaces `fabric-platform-notebook-pipelines/platform/pipeline.py`, which is a
`STEPS = [(name, description), …]` list run in order, stopping at the first
failure. The steps were always a graph; a list was the only shape available
without an orchestrator. Here the four vendors genuinely are independent, so
they are four mapped tasks that retry alone rather than four positions in a
sequence where the second failing means the third never runs.

TASK SDK ONLY (`airflow.sdk`). That is Airflow 3's boundary between task code
and the scheduler's internals, and it is what lets this same file run on a
managed Airflow in production without edits.

NOTHING HERE NAMES A TARGET. `conn_id="fabric"` is the whole of it: no host, no
tenant, no grant type, no branch on emulator-versus-real. The platform
provisions that connection against fabric-emulator locally and against real
Fabric in production, and this file cannot tell the difference — which is the
property that makes "the same DAGs, against real Fabric" true rather than hoped
for.

# `target/run_results.json` -- the only record of WHICH tests an invocation
# actually evaluated -- is deleted with the clone. `scripts/snapshot.py` had no
# way to read it, so it named the contracts by globbing `gold/tests/*.sql`: a
# list of what the project CONTAINS, published as though it were what the run
# CHECKED. Those agree only when nothing went wrong, which is precisely the
# case the field exists for.
#
# dbt honours DBT_TARGET_PATH as an absolute path, so the artefacts land
# somewhere both the task and the snapshot can see. GOLD ONLY: silver's dbt
# writes its own run_results, and one shared directory would let silver's
# verdict be read as gold's -- the same confusion between two artefacts that
# the `args.which` assertion below exists to catch between two commands.
#
# The nine model tasks write here too, and race; that is harmless because
# `gold_test` runs after all of them (TestBehavior.AFTER_ALL) and is therefore
# the last writer, and because a snapshot that read a model task's artefact by
# mistake is refused rather than published -- see snapshot.py.

# an unset value stops the DAG appearing at all. The real value is supplied per
# run; this only has to exist.
#
# IT WAS FIXED THERE AFTER ALL. This used to set LAKEHOUSE_ID, because gold's
# default was `env_var('CONTOSO_SILVER_DATABASE', env_var('LAKEHOUSE_ID'))` and
# Jinja evaluates a default EAGERLY, so the Fabric-only fallback was required on
# every engine. The comment here argued that changing a shared project to suit
# one consumer's renderer was the wrong direction -- sound reasoning from a
# false premise, because the nesting was a defect in the project rather than a
# quirk of Cosmos. Core v0.6.0 removed it and moved the names, since Snowflake's
