The Contoso **data product** for Apache Airflow 3: dlt sources that land four
vendors into a Fabric Lakehouse, dbt models that take bronze to gold, and the
ODCS contracts that gate every hop.

It is a **product, not a platform.** There is no Airflow here and no
fabric-emulator here — no compose file, no Dockerfile, no image pin. A platform
is `make`'d and pointed at this repo:

```sh
make up     # -> ../fabric-platform-airflow3, with this directory as the product
make run    # trigger contoso_daily
```

## What the product contains

The SQL is not here. It lives in the core so seven leaves cannot drift into
seven versions of it, and that costs you a click, so this list exists to give
it back. `make show-product` copies the same files into `product/` where you
can open them; the block below is generated from the pinned package and a test
fails when it falls behind.

<!-- BEGIN product inventory: python -m contoso_product.show --markdown -->

The product is [`contoso-data-product`](https://github.com/calvinchengx/contoso-data-product/tree/v0.6.2) at **v0.6.2**, the version this repository pins. It is not vendored here: these files live there and are staged locally by `make show-product`.

## How Airflow picks this up

Three different mechanisms, and conflating them is where setups go wrong:

| what | how | where it is configured |
|---|---|---|
| DAG **files** | a DAG bundle rooted at `dags/` | the platform (`LocalDagBundle` locally, `GitDagBundle` at a tag in production) |
| **dependencies** | `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml` into the worker | the platform's 3-line Dockerfile |
| **task code** | `from airflow.sdk import …` — the Airflow 3 Task SDK | here |

The bundle delivers files and installs nothing. That is why `pyproject.toml`
lists what the worker must import, and why there is no `requirements.txt`.

## How it reaches Fabric

`conn_id="fabric"`, and nothing else. No host, no tenant, no grant type, and no
branch on emulator-versus-real. The platform provisions that connection against
fabric-emulator locally and against real Fabric in production; this repo cannot
tell which answered, which is what makes "the same DAGs, against real Fabric" a
property rather than a hope.

## The four sources, and why they are four different problems

| vendor | transport | format | shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contoso POS | HTTP / OpenAPI | delimited text + JSON Lines | **paged** — parts land separately |
| Contoso Web | HTTP / OpenAPI | JSON arrays | **nested** — orders carry their `lines` |
| Contoso Reference | HTTP / OpenAPI | **Parquet** | master data, not paged |
| Contoso ERP | Debezium → Redpanda | **CDC change stream** | not HTTP at all |

Three of them are operational systems; Reference is the group data office's
publisher, which is why it is a vendor rather than a table maintained here.

## Landing is verbatim, and dlt does not get to reshape it

    Landed VERBATIM — no parsing, no reshaping. Bronze's job is to be the bytes
    as they arrived, so that a question about the source can be answered
    without going back to the vendor.

dlt owns the hard part — paging, auth, retry, incremental state — and its
resources yield a **manifest** of what was fetched and where it went. The
vendor's bytes go to OneLake unchanged and never pass through dlt's normaliser.

**dlt's own Azure destinations are deliberately not used.** Measured against the
emulator: dlt's credential model carries account-key, SAS and service-principal
shapes and has **no bearer field**, so a raw `storage_options` dict is
unrecognised and dlt falls through to `DefaultAzureCredential`. Run without
network isolation, that authenticated against **real Microsoft endpoints** using
the developer's own `az login` state. So writes go through delta-rs and stdlib
HTTP — the two paths this emulator is already witnessed against, neither of
which has a credential chain to fall through.

## Not the emulator's Airflow

fabric-emulator has an `ApacheAirflowJob` item and an Airflow sidecar. That is
the **opposite** direction: Fabric as the control plane, driving Airflow. Here
Airflow is the control plane and Fabric is a target. This repo never touches
`ApacheAirflowJob` and the platform never sets `FABRIC_AIRFLOW_URL`.

Apache-2.0.
