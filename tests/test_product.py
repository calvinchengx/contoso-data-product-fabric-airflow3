    reported PASS=1 ERROR=0, so a task that did its work was recorded failed,
    one run in two, on a graph whose whole purpose is to be compared against
    another graph. Nothing could see it until `make verify` ran the pipeline
    twice.

    IT ASSERTS `emit_datasets`, NOT `outlets`, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS
    TEST HAD THAT WRONG. Cosmos's own parameter doc says emission happens
    "during task execution": a rendered task carries NO outlets either way, so
    `assert not task.outlets` passes identically with emission on and off and
    could never catch this. Measured rather than reasoned about -- the pre-fix
    DAG renders 0 outlets, exactly as the fixed one does.

    What made the earlier version look like it worked is worse than a false
    pass. With the flag removed it DID fail -- but with
    `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: variable`, because emission-on
    sends cosmos through its Variable cache and the test omitted the
    `AIRFLOW__COSMOS__ENABLE_CACHE` monkeypatch its siblings set. A crash in
    the right direction reads exactly like a working guard. The monkeypatch
    below removes the crash, so what remains is an assertion or nothing.

    `emit_datasets` IS observable on the rendered operator, and it is the value
    the task will actually use at run time. Checked in both directions: every
    task False as written, and `False, True` with the knob removed.
